Problem Number: 2
Programmer: Liliana Pantoja
Section: 400/M40

Purpose: Susan bought 750 shares of stock at a price of $35.00 per 
share. She must pay her stockbroker a 2 percent commission for the 
transaction. Write a program that calculates and displays the following:

  •   The amount paid for the stock alone (without the commission)  
  •   The amount of the commission 
  •   The total amount paid (for the stock plus the commission)

    totalPaid = stockAlone + commissionAmount;                  //Calculate the total amount paid

    //Displaying the final results using the static cast to convert the doubles into int and printing decimals for the constant variable.
